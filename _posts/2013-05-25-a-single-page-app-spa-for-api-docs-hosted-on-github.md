{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was turned on to a cool blog post coming out of content deliver network NetDNA, where they are converting their API docs from a closed source, convoluted PHP script to auto generated markdown that is hosted on Github pages.The resulting API documentation is a pretty sweet single page application (SPA) for API documentation.Using Github to host API documentation is nothing new, but deploying them as a very clean, usable SPA is something I havent seen before.This approach is following a larger trend in building SPA with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, but also hosting these entirely client side markup or markdown, CSS and JS apps using Github.The resulting NetDNA API documentation SPA is very sexy, easy to read, as well as navigate.</p>
