<p>At BRANDiD, we’re totally in love with Parse, which is saving us months and months of backend programming the more we use it.We also really love AngularJS for all its insane two-way data binding, its declarative semantics, and commitment to modularity.All of this means you can build apps FAST.And that’s exactly what Parse wants to help you do too.In fact, we think AngularJS and Parse are a match made in heaven.</p>
