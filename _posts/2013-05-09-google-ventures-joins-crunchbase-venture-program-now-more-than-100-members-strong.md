{% include JB/setup %}<p>Since launching the CrunchBase Venture Program at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC last week, we’ve added more than 100 venture firms, angel groups, and incubators to the program including Google Ventures. Together our partners have taken part in over 3,900 funding rounds, funded 2,700 companies, and helped guide investment of over $35B. Beyond the numbers, each firm we’ve spoken to has given us incredible feedback about the platform and offered their support in building out an open, timely, and accurate dataset.Here’s a sampling of what we are hearing:
 SoftTech VC is very excited to support the development of Crunchbase into an even more comprehensive data set for our community of startups and investors.We have been using it heavily as part of our day to day, and we’re thrilled to hear about AOL’s interest in expanding it.</p>
