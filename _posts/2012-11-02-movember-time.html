<p>Movember is an annual event where participants grow moustaches in the month of November to raise awareness and funds for treating prostate cancer. We decided, as a team, to participate in Movember. Sure we’ll stick out, but it’ll be symbolic of efforts to alleviates men’s health issues.Here are our photos as of today, starting out. As you can see, a couple of us got pretty pumped and already have moustaches.</p>
