<p>Dynamic Websites Using the AWS SDK for JavaScript in the Browser, Part 2: Auth0 and Token-based Authentication
301 level guidance from an AWS Solutions Architect
Introduction
The previous post introduced the AWS SDK for JavaScript in the Browser and showed you how to set it up with Login with Amazon for web identity federation.We used this technique to gain read and write access to an Amazon DynamoDB table without including AWS credentials in our JavaScript code.We then added NVD3 to visualize the query results.Finally we demonstrated how to lock down your data by adding fine-grained access control to your Amazon DynamoDB tables with IAM policies that reference unique federated user IDs.In today’s post we’re going to take it up a notch and learn how to build more complex sites with persistent sessions and many more authentication options.</p>
