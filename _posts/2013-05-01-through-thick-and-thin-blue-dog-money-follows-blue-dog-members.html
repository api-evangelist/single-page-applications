<p>Since its 1995 formation, the caucus of moderate and conservative Democrats in the House known as the Blue Dog Coalition has grown and shrunk.And then shrunk some more.But Blue Dog campaign money has stuck to Blue Dogs like ticks on a hound, through thick and thin.Unlike other congressional caucuses rooted in shared ideology, such as the Tea Party Caucus, the Blue Dogs have supported each other financially to an unusual degree.Blue Dog Democrats overall tend to give a disproportionate amount of money to fellow Blue Dogs over other Dems, according to Center for Responsive Politics research.</p>
