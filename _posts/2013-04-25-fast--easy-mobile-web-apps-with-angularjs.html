<p>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about how to Build Mobile Web Apps with AngularJS and the Salesforce Platform and earlier this week I talked with the Philadelphia Force.Com Developer User Group about how to do this. As part of this talk, I wrote up step by step instructions for adding an Account list to the demo app. I’m happy to share those today via  a gist. If you’re looking for a few next steps with the mobile pack, this is a great way to continue your learning.</p>
