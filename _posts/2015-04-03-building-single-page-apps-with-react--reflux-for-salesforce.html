<p>We are taking a slight detour in our Building with React & Flux series to show how straight forward it is to write Single Page Applications (SPA) with React and Reflux for Salesforce.If you are just hopping into this series then definitely check out the Building with React & Flux: Getting Started to get up to speed on React and Flux.In the last post we built a simple app to manage banner ads using React and RefluxJS, an implementation of Flux.I thought to myself,.self, lets take this same app and build it in Salesforce and see what it takes.</p>
