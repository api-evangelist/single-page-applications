<p>At the start, critics often said, Twitter is fun, but its not useful.At one point @ev responded dryly with, Neither is ice cream.Things have come a long way in a short time.We recognized potential early but users and platform developers would demonstrate how much more Twitter could be.Fostering an open and increasingly important network is not as easily dismissed as it once wasâ€”but its still fun!</p>
