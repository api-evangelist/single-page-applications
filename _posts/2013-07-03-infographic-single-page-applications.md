<p>Infographics have always drove me nuts.Aside from being visually attractive, they are worthless.They offer no value, except just being eye candy.The more I spend more time working with concepts like the Single Page Application (SPA) and Hacker Storytelling, the more I desire a more meaningful replacement for the current infographic.I would like to start seeing more data driven, visually appealing infographics that are done with the same class as an SPA.</p>
