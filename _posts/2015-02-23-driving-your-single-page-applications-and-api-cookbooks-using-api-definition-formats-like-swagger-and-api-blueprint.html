<p>24 Feb 2015   
During my monitoring of the API space this last week I had one of those rare discoveries, amongst thousands of misses, and around a hundred slightly interesting nuggets, a simple move forward called Lucybot emerges.Â 
I want to walk you through what I experienced as I had the tab open in my Chrome browser for the last week, in Lucybots own words:
LucyBot is a tool for on-boarding new API developers, and is meant to be used alongside traditional API documentation such as Swagger and I/O Docs.I really like this sentence when they start talking about generating API cookbooks:
LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API.Design step-by-step walk-throughs for any use case, and LucyBot will provide cross-language code snippets, which expand into a working, visually-rich demo.Now you are talking my language.</p>
