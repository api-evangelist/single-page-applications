<p>Most, if not all, modern enterprise software needs to have a role-based user interface to support common-place use cases like, for example, devolved administration; i.e.User X is an coordinator for Group Y, allowing him or her to perform admin functions for that Group.Â  This is just an example, of course, there are plenty of others.Spring provides support for many common authentication and authorization patterns and standards like OAuth2 and user management through LDAP or CAS.</p>
