It helps development teams deliver quality web services and applications in reduced amounts of time. &nbsp;Web services are a great way to extend your application, however, adding a web API to an existing web application can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Apify takes certain common patterns found in most web services and abstract them so that you can quickly write web APIs without having to write too much code.\nAPIfy aims to help organizations open up APIs to developer communities, in a fast, simple and secure way. APIs promise to help organizations drive new revenue and reach across mobile and cloud. They can also make organizations more responsive to changing customer needs by giving them the data and application access they need, when they need it.\nBut understanding best practices for opening up APIs to outside communities can be daunting. APIfy distils the lessons from over 10 years of experience gained at Layer 7 Technologies into a simple-to-configure, all-cloud API Management-as-a-Service offering.\n&nbsp;","website":"http:\/\/www.apify.co\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/api_fy","github":"","blog":"http:\/\/www.apify.co\/blog\/","blogrss":"http:\/\/www.apify.co\/blog\/feed\/","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/apify-logo.png","screenshot":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/Apify-Screenshot.png","tags":"API Deployment,API Management,API-Deployment"},{"id":"28","name":"Emergent One","summary":"Emergent One is an API platform that allows you to quickly generate and launch a new API from MySQL or Postegres databases connection. &nbsp;After launched a developer portal is providing API registration, documentation, blog and console. &nbsp;Emergent One automatically generates documentation and code samples, and provides access controls, caching and analytics for managing your API.","details":"Emergent One is an API platform that allows you to quickly generate and launch a new API from MySQL or Postegres databases connection. &nbsp;After launched a developer portal is providing API registration, documentation, blog and console. &nbsp;Emergent One automatically generates documentation and code samples, and provides access controls, caching and analytics for managing your API.","website":"http:\/\/www.emergentone.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/emergent_one","github":"","blog":"http:\/\/www.emergentone.com\/blog\/engineering\/","blogrss":"","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/emergent-one-logo.png","screenshot":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/EmergentOne-Screenshot.png","tags":"API Deployment,API Management,API-Deployment"},{"id":"22","name":"Intel\u00ae Expressway Service Gateway","summary":"Intel&reg; Expressway Service Gateway provides an enforcement point for REST web services messages and can delegate authentication and authorization to identity management and PKI systems such as Active Directory and CA* Siteminder.
